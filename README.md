# Hand AI 
Here is the code used in the following article: TODO(zkbaum) add link to article.

TODO(zkbaum) add a brief explanation about the key entry points (`run_inference.py`, `run_assistants_v2_inference.py`, graph creation, and ANOVA).

Notices: 
* I am making the code public to show how the automation works. If you are interested in running this yourself, note the code will not work out-of-the-box because I did not make the dataset public (it is owned by the ASSH) and many paths are hard-coded to my machine. 
* This is a side project, meaning the code is not up to industry standards (e.g. no tests, limited documentation, etc). This does not reflect my code quality standards for professional software engineering projects.
* If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
